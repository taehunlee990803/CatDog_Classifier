# Cat and Dog Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The CNN is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it's trained on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images.

## Contents

* convolutional_neural_network.py: The Python script containing the CNN implementation.
* README.md: This file (you're reading it now!).
## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of the following layers:

* Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
* Max-pooling layers
* Flattening layer
* Fully connected layers
* Output layer with sigmoid activation
## Training

The model is trained using the following steps:

1. Compilation: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss.
2. Training: The model is trained on a training set of images for a specified number of epochs.
3. Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on a test set of images.
## Making Predictions

Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new images. The script includes a section for making predictions on a single image.

## Dependencies

* TensorFlow
* Keras
## Instructions

1. Dataset Preparation:

* Organize your dataset into separate folders for training and testing.
* Within each folder, create subfolders named 'cat' and 'dog' for the respective images.
2. Model Configuration:

* Adjust the model parameters in the cnn_cat_dog.py script as needed.
3. Training:

* Run the convolutional_neural_network.py script to train the model.
4. Making Predictions:

* Use the provided code snippet in the script to make predictions on new images.
## Results

The accuracy and loss of the model on the test set will be displayed during and after training.

## Additional Notes

* Consider adjusting the model architecture and hyperparameters to potentially improve performance.
* Explore different techniques for data augmentation to increase the size and variability of the training set.
